# Sentiment Analysis of the response to the cancellation of the zero-COVID policy in China on Twitter

## Abstract
The project aims to analyze the sentiment of Twitter users towards the revocation of China's zero-COVID policy, which has been met with mixed reactions from both domestic and international communities. 

My question is whether people are primarily positive or negative about the policy change.

The hypothesis suggests that the sentiments will be mixed, with negative sentiments being more dominant due to previous global criticism of the policy. 

Data was collected using the Twitter API, covering tweets with specific keywords such as "zero-COVID policy," "COVID in China," and "China COVID policy." 

The methodology includes overview of tweets over time, conducting sentiment analysis and detailed anaylsis, and using NLTK to extract the most frequently occurring words and do sentiment anaylysis on the NLTK words. 

The conclusion suggests that there was no clear trend in users' opinions, and the hypothesis is proved that negative opinions were more prevalent. 
Sentiment analysis on NTLK words can provide some insights into how people describe the policy, but it is not a perfect measure of people's opinions on Twitter.
